functions/process_optical_properties_skin_Fat_muscle_placenta.m
Process optical properties of maternal abdomen (mua, mus, n, g)

functions/get_epsilon.m
Read absorption and molar extinction coefficient from txt files in the folder "spectra"



process_StO2_LookupTable.m	
Generate braodband spectra for the 8 detectors (SD source separation 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 cm) for 3 subjects.
The layer thicknesses corresponded to those of the Prospekt dataset (1st quartile, median and 3rd quartile of the distance to placenta).
The varying parameters are: volume fraction of melanosome, Total hemoglobin concentration in placenta and muscle, Oxygen saturation in placenta and muscle



plot_model.m
Plot the modelled maternal abdomen using mcxpreview function

model_Phantom.m
Simulations of the multi-layered phantom using CYRIL


Create_Lookup_Table.m
Create lookup table of tissue sensitivity indexes for the 8 detectors (SD source separation 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 cm).
The varying parameters are the layer thicknesses (skin, adipose tissue, muscle), the volume fraction of melanosome, 
the total hemoglobin concentration in placenta and muscle, and the oxygen saturation in placenta and muscle
